readProjPoints.C: general Macro for checking the projPoints from the projector 
	
readVPadPlane.C: plots the R3BGTPCProjPoint which contains the virtual pads calculated after the projection of the track.

run_readVPadPlane.C: helper macro to run readVPadPlane.C with an input file
run_readVPadPlane_lang.C: the same

run_proj.C: for the simple projection (modified after for input and output file)

run_lang.C: for the langevin (modified after for input and output file)


TEST files: test on a large geometry to evaluate deformation
 run_lang_test.C: macro for the test geometry
 results_0 to results_4 contain the results at different distances from pad plane.
 map_lang.C, plot_canvas.C and showshowDeviation.C (in results_#) are macros for the analysis of the data


TOMC files: test on a large geometry on the magnet coordinates (rotated chamber wrt R3B coordinate system)
 run_lang_test.C

NOTE ON COORDINATES: 
 Following R3BGladFieldMap.cxx:  fPosX = 0.0; fPosY = 0.0; fPosZ = 163.4; fYAngle = -14.;
 THIS SHOULD BE THE CENTER OF THE FIELD MAP, BUT IT IS NOT SYMMETRIC IN THE MAGNET COORDINATES!!!
 I DID A CHECK: in the code of LangevinTest I ask for the field in coordinates:
  - (0, 0, 163.4) I get the exact magnetic field corresponding to (0,0,0) in the field file. 
  - (50*sin(14),0,163.4+50*cos(14)) I got the exact field corresponding to (0,0,50), ... 
 SO THE FILE IS IN THE RIGTH POSITION, BUT THE GEOMETRY IS NOT!!! (cause the point (0, 0, 163.4) is not centered in the case!)
 Its difficult to understand the transformation in create_tpc_geo_TOMC.C... It seems to work opposite to what expected. 
 Manually I put a 200cm long chamber starting in the (0,0,0) position of the map field or (0, 0, 163.4) in target coordinates.
 For that, I have used 
 Double_t TPCLx = 40; //halfsizes
 Double_t TPCLy = 20;
 Double_t TPCLz = 100;
 Double_t TargetAngle=-14;
 Double_t TargetOffsetX=40;   
 Double_t TargetOffsetY=0;
 Double_t TargetOffsetZ=260;   

 BUT this are not the expected values... the offset should be 100*sin(14)= 24.19 and 63.4+100*cos(14)=260.49, 
 but this was far to the right, more taking into account that the real center of the map point seems to be shifted to the left!!!






OLD, remove mostly due to the difficulty in the interpretation of the deviations
