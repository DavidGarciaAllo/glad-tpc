Naming scheme for the classes:

R3BGTPC[function] e.g. R3BGTPCLangevin

- R3BGTPC: 						it's the core of the simulation.
- R3BGTPCLangevin: 		Electron drift using the langevin equations.
- R3BGTPCProjector: 	Electron drift using a simple linear projector toward the pad plane.
- R3BGTPCGeoPar: 			Parameters for the creation of the different HYDRA geometries, target and to choose the electronics. Everything it's in [cm] and [deg].
